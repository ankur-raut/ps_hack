      <p>&nbsp;What is c++ ? What is the advantages of c++ ?</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>
        C++ is an object oriented programming language Initially c++ was name as
        “c with classes”. C++ was developed by Bjarne stroustrup at &amp; T Bell
        Laboratories , usa , in the early eighties . Advantages of c++ over c
        are :
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>
        (1) c++ is an incremented version of of c . It is sperset of c. almost
        all c programme are also run in c++ compiler .
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>
        (2) The important faculties added in c++ are classes , function
        overloading , operator overloading .
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>
        (3) C++ allow user to create abstract data type , to inherit properties
        from existing data type .
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>(4) c++ supports polymorphism .</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>
        (5) Any real life application systems such as editor , compiler ,
        database , communication system can be built by c++.
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>(6) Object oriented libraries can be built by c++.</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>
        (7) c++ programs can be easily implemented , maintained and expanded.
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>
        What do you mean by object based programming language and object
        oriented programming language? State the relationship between these
        language .
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p> Object based programming language:</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>
        (1) language that supports programming with object are said to be object
        based programming language .
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>
        (2) it is a style of programming that primarily supports encapsulation
        &amp; object or identity.
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>(3) Major feature are :</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>(a) Data encapsulation</p>
      <p>(b) Data hiding &amp; access mechanism.</p>
      <p>(c) Automatic initalization &amp; clean-up objects</p>
      <p>(d) operator overloading .</p>
      <p>(4) They do not support inheritance &amp; dynamic binding .</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>Object- oriented programming language:</p>
      <p>
        (1) This language incorporates all the object based feature along with
        inheritance and dynamic binding .
      </p>
      <p>(2) For eg. – c++, smalltalk.</p>
      <p>The relation between them characterized by followings statement :</p>
      <p>
        Object oriented programming =. Object based feature + inheritance +
        dynamic binding .
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>
        Advantages of object oriented programming : (1) through , inheritance ,
        eliminate redundant code and extend the use of existing classes. (2) The
        principle of data hiding helps the programmer to build secure program.
        (3) It is possible . To have multiple instances of an object to co exist
        without any interference . (4) It is easy to partition the work in a ;
        project based on object .
      </p>

      <p>Data types</p>
      <p>
        • C++ allows user to create new abstract data types , which can behave
        like any built in data types.
      </p>
      <p>
        • These are called user-define data types. These includes structure
        ,union, class , enumeration.
      </p>
      <p>
        • C++ provides three built-in data types which are integral , void,
        floating .
      </p>
      <p>
        • Integral includes integer and character while floating type include
        float and double
      </p>
      <p>
        • In addition to these data types C++ provide user with array , function
        , and pointer which are called as derived data types.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enlist the basic data types used in c++ with size of data in term of
        bytes for each .
      </p>
      <p>
        There are three main basic built – in data types used in c++ viz.
        integral type , void and floating type.
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p> Integral data type :</p>
      <p>It include integer (int) and characters (char) .</p>
      <p>
        An int variable requires 2 bytes to store , while a character variable
        requires 1 byte.
      </p>
      <p>Integer variables are also of two types :</p>
      <p>(a) short int (b) long int.</p>
      <p>
        long integer requires 4 bytes , while short integers requires 2 bytes .
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>Void data type :</p>
      <p> Void data type is used :</p>
      <p>
        (a) to specify the return type of a function when it is not returning
        any value .
      </p>
      <p>(b) to indicate an empty argument list to a function .</p>
      <p>(c) to declare generic pointers .</p>
      <p>Floating type :</p>
      <p> Floating type variables are of two types ; float and double.</p>
      <p>
        A float variables requires 4 bytes , while double requires 8 bytes to
        store in memory .
      </p>
      <p>
         There is another kind of double namely long double , which requires 10
        bytes to store in memory .
      </p>
      <p>
        Write a short note on scope resolution operator ? (oct. 2014 ; mar. 2016
        )
      </p>
      <p>(1) The operator :: is called as scope resolution operator .</p>
      <p>
        (2) C++ is a block structure language i.e a c++ program may contain one
        block within another block .
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) When a variables is declared in program , scope extends from the
        point of declaration till the end of the block in which it is defined .
      </p>
      <p>(4) The same variables name can be used to have different.</p>

        &nbsp;<b>Explain the concept of function overloading with example .</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of same function name to create function that perform a variety
        of different tasks is called as function overloading .<br />Overloading
        refers to the use of same thing for different purpose .<br />Function
        overloading or function polymorphism , is an example of compile time
        polymorphism .<br />Using the concept function overloading , create a
        family of function with one function name but with different argument
        lists.<br />The function would perform different operation , depending
        on argument list in function call.<br />The correct function to be
        invoked is determined by checking the number and the type of the
        argument and not on the function type .<br />When a function is called
        , the compiler first matches the prototype having same number and types
        of arguments and then calls appropriate function for execution . A best
        match must be unique.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Pointers :</b><br />• A pointer is a variable which hold the memory
        address of another variable<br />• * operator is use to declear pointer
        in c++.<br />• It takes the form as :<br />• Datatype *variable name
        ;<br />• E.g. int *ptr:<br />• The above declearation will create a
        variable ptr which is a pointer variable and which will point to a
        variable whose datatype is integer.<br />• The data type of ptr is not
        integer but datatype of variable which ptr will point is integer .<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Advantages of pointer :</b><br />• It allows to pass variable array
        ,function, string, structure, object as function arguments .<br />• It
        allow to return structured variable from functions.<br />• It support
        dynamic allocation and deallocation of memory segment .<br />• By using
        pointer variable can be swapped without physically moving them<br />• It
        allow to establish link between data elements or objects.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Call by value :</b><br />• Pointer is a variable which hold the
        address of another variable.<br />• * operator are used to declear
        pointer .<br />• The use of pointer in a function definition may be
        classified into two group :<br />Call by value.<br />Call by reference
        .<br />• Call by value :<br />• When the portion of the program invokes
        a function control will be transfer from main function to the calling
        function and the value of actual argument is copied to the function .<br />•
        Within function the actual value may be altered or changed.<br />• When
        the control is transferred back from function to the program, altered
        values are not transeferred back this type of passing formal arguments
        to the<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Call by reference :</b><br />• Call by reference :<br />• In call by
        reference when the function is called by a program the address of actual
        argument are copied on to the formal arguments i.e.formal and actual
        argument referring same memory location .<br />• Therefore change in
        value of formal argument affect the value of actual arguments<br />• The
        content of variable that are alter within thee function are return to
        calling portion of program in alter form.

      <p>&nbsp;<b>Object oriented programming</b></p>
      <p>
        • Object oriented programming is an approach that provides a way of
        modularizing programs by creating partitioned memory area for both data
        and function that can be used as templates for creating copies of such
        modules on demand .<br />• In object oriented programming the program is
        designed around the data being operated upon rather than upon the
        operation themselves.<br />• OOP allows to decompose a problem into a
        number of entities called object and then build data and function around
        these entity.<br />• When program is executed the object interact by
        sending message to one another<br />• Each object contains data and code
        to manipulate the data .<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Features of OOP :</b><br />• Program are divided into number of
        object.<br />• Data is hidden and cannot be accessed by external
        function<br />• Object may communicate with each other through
        function<br />• New data and function can be easily added wherever
        required.<br /><b>Object :</b><br />• Object are the basic runtime
        entity in object oriented system .<br />• For e.g they may represent a
        person , a place , a bank.<br />• Programming problem is analyzed in
        term of object and the nature of communication between them .<br />•
        Program object should be chosen such that they match closely with the
        real world object .<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Class :</b><br />• Class is way to bind a data and is associated
        functions together.<br />• The entire set of data and code of an object
        can be made an user define datatype with the help of class<br />• Infact
        an object is nothing but a variable whose datatype is class<br />• Once
        a class has been define user define any number of object belonging to
        that class<br />• Class is a collection of object of similar type.<br />

        <b
          >What are friendly function? Give the characteristics of a friendly
          function .</b
        ><br /> C++ allows the common function to be made friendly with more
        than one classes , thereby allowing the function to have access to the
        private data of class . Such a function need not be a member of any
        classes.<br /> Non-member function cannot have access to the private
        data of a class . However , there could be a situation where user would
        like two classes to share a particular function. At this situation
        friend function is used.<br /> The keyboard “ friend ” declare the
        function to be friendly with that class. This function is defined as a
        normal c++ function . The function definition does not use class – name
        , keyboard friend or scope resolution operator.<br /> A friend function
        has following characteristics :<br />(1) It is not in the scope of the
        class to which it has been declared as friend .<br />(2) since it is not
        in scope of the class, it cannot be called by using object of that class
        . It is called like a normal c++ function .<br />(3) It can be declared
        either in public or the private part of a class without affecting is
        meaning .<br />(4) Usually , it has the objects as arguments.<br />(5)
        It cannot access the member function directly and has to use an object
        name and dot operator with each member name .

      <p>&nbsp;<b>What is a constructor ? Why it is called so?</b></p>
      <p>
        “A constructor is a special member function of a class . Its task is to
        initialize the objects of its class. ”<br />It is special because its
        name is same as that of the class to which it belongs.<br />The
        constructor is invoked whenever an object of its associated class is
        created.<br />It is called constructor because it constructs the values
        of data members of the class.<br />A constructor can never return any
        value. Hence ,it is written with no return type ( even void is not
        written ).<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever a class contain a constructor like one above , it will be
        initialized automatically , whenever an object of the class is
        created.<br />i.e. the declaration – integer int1;<br />This not only
        creates the object int1 of type integer , also initializes its data
        members m and n to zero .<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >Give the characteristics of a constructor function .or Syntax rule
          for writing constructors.</b
        ><br />The constructor name is always same as the class name .<br />They
        do not have return types , not even void and therefore, they cannot
        return values.<br />They cannot be static or virtual .<br />They
        should be declared in public section .<br />They cannot be inherited
        though a derived class can call base class constructor .<br /> Like
        other c++ function , they can have default arguments .<br /> We cannot
        refer to their address .<br /> An object with a constructor cannot be
        used as a member of union .<br /> They make implicit calls to the
        operator ‘new’ and ‘delete’ when memory allocation is required.<br />
        When a constructor is declared for a class , initialization of class
        objects become mandatory , since constructor is invoked automatically
        when the objects are created.<br />

        <b>What is inheritance ? Explain with suitable example .</b><br /> The
        mechanism of deriving a new class from an old called is inheritance .<br />
        The old class is referred as base class and new class is reffered as
        derived class.<br /> C++ strongly supports the concept of reusability .
        Once a class has been written and tested , if can be adapted by other
        programmers to suit their requirement .<br /> This is basically done by
        creating new classes , reusing the properties of the existing ones<br />Functions
        and variables of a class that has been tested can be used by object of
        another class . This is known as inheritance<br />. The reuse of a
        class that has alreadynbeen tested , debugged and used many times , can
        save the efforts of developing and testing the same again .<br /><b
          >Explain the concept of virtual function .</b
        ><br />When user use the same function name in both the base and
        derived classes, the function in the base class is derived as virtual
        using the keyboard ‘virtual’ preceding its normal declaration .<br />When
        a function is made virtual , c++ determines which function to use at
        runtime , based on the type of object pointed to by the base pointer
        .<br />Thus , by making the base pointer to point two different objects
        it can execute different versions of the virtual function .<br />Virtual
        function can be accessed through the use of pointer declared as a
        pointer to the base class .<br />Also, the prototypes of the base class
        version of virtual function and all the derived class version must be
        identical .<br />If two functions with the same name have different
        prototype ,c++ considers them as overload functions , and the virtual
        mechanism is ingnore<br /><br /><br /><b
